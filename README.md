# Phoebe Event Manager

Phoebe is a minuscule event manager for the command line, with very basic features. This allows for your great ideas to be added quickly to the terminal, where we are
likely spending all of our time.

## Features

In Phoebe, you can do 4 different things:
- add an event to a weekday
- delete an event from a weekday
- view the week or specific days events
- get documentation on all the above commands

## Usage

| Command Name | Usage | Example |
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| Add | pb add [weekday] "event" | pb add Monday "Coffee and code" |
| Week | pb week [weekday] (optional) | pb week |
| Delete | pb del [weekday] "event" | pb del Monday "Coffee and code"

## Installation
